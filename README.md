# Pong clone [phaser + typescript]

## Gameplay
>Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. 
The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen.
They can compete against either a computer-controlled opponent or another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. 
Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. 
The goal is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.
